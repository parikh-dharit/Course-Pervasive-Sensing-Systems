Exercise II
Exercise 1. Load Acc_sensorData
a) Divide the data into frames of 50 samples each: Show a plot indicating the window
b) Divide the data into frames of 1second duration each: Show a plot indicating the window
c) For both cases a) and b), calculate and compare the mean, median, standard deviation and interquartile range of each frame.

Ex 2. Load Gyro_sensorData
a) Perform sample synchronization for the two sensors: research and find out simple algorithms  that are used to synchronize 
b) Interpolate sensor values (from both sensors), starting from the timestamp given by the first accelerometer measurement.
